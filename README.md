Project: Desktop UI Prototype
Goal: To build a web interface that acts and feels like a real computer desktop.

The Tools
HTML: The structure (the icons, the menu, and the taskbar).

SCSS: The beauty (deep blue colors, glass effects, and organized layout).

JavaScript: The life (making the menu open, slide, and close).

Key Features
Smooth Slide Menu: The menu doesn't just "appear"—it glides up from the bottom. It feels high-quality because it uses "transform" animation.

Smart Closing: If you click the desktop icons or even right-click anywhere else, the menu knows to hide itself. This makes it feel like a real Operating System.

Invisible Logic: I used special code (pointer-events) so that even when the menu is hidden, you can still click the folders and icons behind it.

Why it’s special
Most websites are just for reading. This project is for interacting. It’s built with "human logic"—it follows the user’s mouse and reacts the way a real computer would. It is a mix of clean code and a smooth user experience.

"A project built to bridge the gap between a website and a real machine."
